# jquery-showhide

A robust "toggle" plugin for jQuery. Features include:

- Remember the state of the target object in a cookie.
- Change the text of the toggle element (useful if you want the link text to change, e.g. "Show form"/"Hide form").
- Apply classes to the toggle element to give it plus/minus styling.
- Auto focus on a form element within the target element (useful if you are showing a hidden form).

This is meant to be a more feature rich version of jQuery's `.toggle()` function for those situations where you need something with a bit more bling.


## Requirements

Depends on the [jquery.cookie plugin](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie) and is tested using jQuery 1.7.2.
