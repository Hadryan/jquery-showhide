# jquery-showhide

A robust "toggle" plugin for jQuery. Features include:

- Remember the state of the target object in a cookie.
- Change the text of the toggle element (useful if you want the link text to change, e.g. "Show form"/"Hide form").
- Apply classes to the toggle element to give it plus/minus styling.
- Auto focus on a form element within the target element (useful if you are showing a hidden form).
